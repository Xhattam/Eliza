#This is the bloody loop I had problems with. It seems to work fine now, it needs to be put 
#in the main body though, and I think only this will be needed here, since until the quit button is pressed,
#the mainloop function will keep on receiving and calculating events coming from the window.
#But I really want to test this asap just in case more problems arise after the response calculation.
#If you want to have a look at Tkinter, feel free since I was having a really hard time fixing this
#and I might need help if more problems arise afterwards.
